Python basics
Don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel! Use preexisting python libraries. 

In my experience, working on a toy example that keeps you entertained is a nice way to get exposure to different principles such as basic python commands & data cleaning / wrangling. The kaggle Titanic tutorial is a good example of this, and also serves as a superficial intro to machine learning.

Udacity has a python intro course, but I can‚Äôt vouch for its quality:
https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110

A little dry, but the official tutorial is very thorough:
https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/

Dartmouth CS1 interactive python textbook. Jennifer L. took this class with Prof. Tom Cormen and it introduces algorithm logic well:

Managing Python Environments
R basics

General CS
A great introduction to CS concepts (for those of you who like understanding things before doing them): https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x

Matlab basics
Learn python instead.
But do learn about vectorization, which Matlab does very well.

Git Basics

Machine learning
Andrew Ng‚Äôs ML course is still one of the best introductions to basic principles of ML, with just the right amount of background / math / linear algebra:
Machine Learning by Stanford University | Coursera
A new version of this course will be released soon (https://bit.ly/3KW22wj), but I think the original course is as relevant as it was back when it was released.
Deep learning specialization with Andrew Ng, at least first course gives a good overview
Deep Learning Book
Hands on ML book
Neural networks class - Universit√© de Sherbrooke ‚Äì Hugo leads the Google Brain and has this amazing course where he introduces artificial neural networks and goes deeper into some of the commonly used AI models.


Data wrangling and bioinformatics
Bioinformatics data skills, good book on various bioinformatics tools

Statistics
Statquest: fun, clear and concise stats explanations
The Elements of Statistical Learning: covers a lot of ML concepts too
Single cell genomics
The Satija lab has excellent tutorials for single cell genomics:
https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started.html
For example, this is a nice primer for clustering: https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html
Alternatively, the same can be done using scanpy from the Theis lab:
https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html
Scanpy ecosystem of different packages
https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ecosystem.html
Not a tutorial, just a good library: Library to parse FASTA and FASTQ files quickly

Data Visualization and Dashboarding
Plotly (graphing library): https://plotly.com/python/
Plotly Dash (dashboard making library - by Plotly): https://dash.plotly.com/introduction
