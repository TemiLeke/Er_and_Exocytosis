# Porject Directory Structrue:

- data : Simulation and raw project data for AD and WT configurations as specified in methods
- docs : documentation and Markdown
- misc : Miscallaneous data, figures and codes designed for supplementary information
- results : figures, checkpoints, and tables generated by codes in scripts directory 
- scripts : Matlab and Python scripts as well as .ipynb notebooks for simulations
- src : reusable Python modules imported into python scripts

## Manuscript Reproduction

To reproduce the complete simulations of the manuscript, run the following matlab codes in "scripts"-folder:
===========================================================================================================

The codes were run on SLURM cluster with Matlab and Python. 

To run the code, ensure all directories and sub-directories are present as detailed above. The ".m" and ".py" files should be availbe in the "scripts"-folder `../scripts/Matlab` and `../scripts/Python` respectively. Figure and data directories are automatically generated by scripts if not already present. The raw simulation data is extremely large, but still written to the specified folder specific to stimulation type. Single AP data is present in `../data/SingleAP`, AP Train (20 AP at 20 Hz) data is present in `../data/APTrain`, and data for paired pulse protocol is available in `../data/PPR`.

To reproduce the complete simulations of the manuscript, run the following matlab codes in "scripts"-folder:

        - solve_PPR_ODEs.m :      For Paired-Pulse Protocol simulation
        - solve_Train_ODEs.m:     For AP train simulation
        - solve_SingleAP_ODEs.m : For single AP simulation 

The paramter ```cell_condition``` specifies the simulation configuration and takes care of parameter switching for WT and AD configurations. 

Although several orders slower, we include and equivalent (not maintained) python code that attempts to reproduce Matlab results.

Raw data generated from either simulation is saved into "../data/<stimulation condition>", and must subsequently be processed using "data_processing.py" in "../scripts/Python/". To reproduce results/figures in the paper, the processed data can be run with scripts prefixed with `generate_figure_`. Supplemental figures can also be generated using scripts prefixed with `supp_figure_` that asssess processed data.
